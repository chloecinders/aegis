# Aegis

A new shell with a modern syntax.

Aegis is 2 parts:
- A new shell language
- The shell wrapping the new language

Goals are to make a modern shell for the command line, with many modern features while not compromising on the usability and performance.

This is in VERY early development! Don't expect much!

As Windows is very lacking in good shells Windows is currently the main priority! Other platform support will come in later. The windows exclusive things are found in the win32 module. Contributions for abstractions and linux/whatever else equivalent functions are much appreciated!
