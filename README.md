# Aegis

A new shell with a modern syntax.

Aegis is 2 parts:
- A new shell language
- The shell wrapping the new language

Goals are to make a modern shell for the command line, with many modern features while not compromising on the usability and performance.

This is in VERY early development! Don't expect much!
